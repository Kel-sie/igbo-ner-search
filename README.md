# Aim and Objectives
The aim is to design and develop Igbo Text Named Identity Recognition (NER) System using Natural Language Processing Algorithms.

## The objectives are to:
1. Create high-quality Igbo dataset for NER
2. Preprocess the dataset 
3. Develop NER that can accurately identify and classify the named entities in Igbo text.
4. Evaluate the performance of named entity recognition system using standard metrics such as F-score, Precision, recall, accuracy.
# Research Questions 
This study is guided by the following questions: 

1. How can a high-quality Igbo dataset for named entity recognition (NER) be created?
2. What are the best preprocessing techniques for preparing Igbo text for NER tasks? 
3. How can an NER system be developed to accurately identify and classify the named entities in Igbo text? 
4. How effective is this NER system when tested using standard metrics such as F-score, precision, accuracy and recall?
